# WTFB
Somewhat sanitized source code for my grandson Julien's web site [whatthef**kshouldinamemyband.com](https://github.com/JulienMelissas/wtfb)

Built in a day or so as an excuse to learn Angular. Using Twitter OAuth for PHP and a simple PHP caching lib.

To run this locally, you'll need to get your own Twitter app `consumer key` and `consumer secret` keys, and run `composer update`
